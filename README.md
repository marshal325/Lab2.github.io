# Lab2 Research Narrative on YouTube Content Analysis

## Introduction
This research project aims to analyze the themes and topics prevalent in various YouTube videos. I focused on three topics: pop music, US news, and content related to the University of Washington. By employing web scraping techniques, I gathered data from YouTube using specific search parameters and then visualized this data through word clouds.

## Search Parameters
In this research, I used different search parameters for each topic:
- University of Washington: Utilized keywords like University of Washington, uw, and univ of washington.
- US News: Focused on cities such as Seattle, Boston, and Houston, using their names along with their geographical coordinates as search parameters.
- Pop Music: Searched with keywords like pop, music, and songs.

## Reason of Comparison
The purpose of comparing these topics and fields is to reveal how different themes are presented on YouTube, a platform with diverse content. By contrasting pop culture, current affairs, and academic-related content, we can understand the differences in language, themes, and user engagement between these categories. Additionally, we can observe through the word cloud results which keywords frequently appear, which are less common, and whether the frequency of each word accurately corresponds to the search parameters used.

## The difference and similarity among the word clouds
- University of Washington: Academic-related terms like research, university, uw were common, along with specific references to university programs and events.
- US News: Terms like election, policy, city name were prominent, indicating a focus on political and regional news.
- Pop Music: The word cloud revealed frequent usage of terms like pop, song, top, suggesting a focus on music releases and popular artists.

The differences in these word clouds highlight how each category caters to its audience's interests, from entertainment in pop music to more serious themes in news and academia. The variation in the word clouds reflects the interests and search preferences of audiences under different themes, and the high-frequency search terms generally align with the content of the topic. Commonly used words like 'watch', 'of', and 'url' also appeared, indicating that these are words we need when searching for any topic.

## Analysis of Patterns
I believe the possible reasons for the patterns observed are because different patterns reflect the inherent nature of each category. Pop music is oriented towards music, entertainment, and celebrity culture; US news centers around current events, politics, and regional developments; while the University of Washington focuses on academic achievements, university life, and educational programs. Thus, different patterns are produced according to the themes of each category.

## Future Improvements
I think future research can be strengthened in several ways, such as including more diverse data sources like social media platforms (Instagram and Twitter) or news websites (BBC News and Fox News). Additionally, more in-depth thematic analysis can be conducted using advanced data analytics and sophisticated web crawling techniques, such as sentiment analysis to understand the emotional tone of the content, providing a more comprehensive and deeper study and data collection.

## Unexpected Findings and Standout Observations
In this lab, I didn't find many things that were different from what I expected in previous exercises. However, when observing the word cloud results, I noticed some incorrect words appeared multiple times, such as 'Pp' and 'Jaar', which I don't think should normally appear as keywords on YouTube pages. This is an issue I need to consider and address in my next steps. I also made an interesting observation that certain regional issues in the US news category were more prominent than expected to be widely covered, and the news I got locally in Seattle was not reported to a great extent in other regions. Additionally, the content related to the University of Washington was more diverse than anticipated, indicating a variety of university life. In the pop music content, terms related to famous artists like 'Lipa' appeared, which aligns with current trends in pop music.
